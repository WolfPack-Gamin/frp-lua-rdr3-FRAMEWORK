This is just a small collection of some random stuff I've been using to figure things out.

Displays Coordinates, Heading (including compass directions) and Time in the bottom left.

## Commands

`golden` will set your cores and outer bars to overpowered

`weather` can be used to quickly change the weather

`weapon` can be used to give yourself a weapon with ammo

`spawn` can be used to spawn a ped

`swap` can be used to quick swap models in a radius around player. Model is only swapped for a few seconds but is helpful for finding possible model names.

`model_search` can be used to find valid models quickly when they are numbered. It tests a few known numbering systems as a suffix to the input value.

`native` can be used to run native commands fairly easily from in game.

So if you wanted to give yourself a Pump Shotgun with the native command you can run:  
ex. `native 0xB282DC6EBD803C75 PLAYER_ID HASH_WEAPON_SHOTGUN_PUMP 500 true 0`  
This will automatically look up hashes if the string starts with `HASH_`. `PLAYER_ID` will be replaced using GetPlayerPed()

Lastly this can either display info of surrounding entities or track them as you come into contact with them based on the Config setting, tracking by default.

`clear_tracking` can be used to clear all currently tracked IDs.

You can disable tracking on specific things near the map. Use `]`, right bracket, to allow clicking to toggle the options. Use `Esc` to close focus.
